Background

A mid-sized technology firm, TechFin Solutions, provides a SaaS-based financial analytics platform serving multiple enterprise clients. Each client organization has dozens of employees accessing dashboards, APIs, and mobile apps to monitor real-time financial insights.

The company originally managed user accounts through a custom authentication layer built into its application code. Over time, as client demand grew and security regulations tightened, the system began to show significant limitations.

Challenges

Scattered Identity Management
Each application module—web portal, mobile app, and partner API—handled user authentication separately. This led to inconsistencies, redundant code, and difficulty enforcing password policies or MFA across all access points.

Complex Access Control Requirements
Clients demanded role-based and attribute-based access, such as:

Finance Analysts should only view data within their department.

Administrators should manage user accounts for their own organization but not others.

Auditors should have read-only access with session expiration policies.

User Federation and SSO Expectations
Several enterprise customers wanted their employees to log in using their existing corporate identities (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID or Google Workspace). The in-house authentication system lacked SAML and OIDC integration capabilities, forcing users to maintain multiple credentials.

Security Compliance and Monitoring
To meet financial industry standards like SOC 2 and ISO 27001, the platform required:

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Centralized session logging and audit trails

Secure token handling for API access

Fine-grained access control for APIs

Scalability and Cost Concerns
During peak business cycles, login traffic surged dramatically. The authentication layer became a performance bottleneck, occasionally failing under heavy load. Scaling the system required additional infrastructure and security management overhead.

Business Goals

Centralize identity management across all applications.

Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Enable API-level access tokens for secure integration with client systems.

Provide support for social and enterprise identity providers.

Reduce operational burden of managing custom authentication code and databases.

Expected Capabilities in the Chosen Solution

The team decided to explore an identity and access management service that could:

Easily integrate with existing mobile, web, and backend APIs.

Support OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 for token-based access.

Handle user pool creation, authentication flows, and token issuance automatically.

Provide built-in features for user sign-up, password reset, and account recovery.

Offer usage-based pricing and automatic scalability.

Impact

After integration, the company achieved:

A unified authentication workflow across all clients and applications.

Seamless login experiences via enterprise and social identity providers.

Enhanced API security through signed JWT tokens.

Reduced development effort and faster onboarding for new clients.

Compliance with security standards and improved audit visibility.
